👋 Hi there, I’m Andrea Maiani (@maiani)

- 🎓 I am a postdoctoral fellow at Nordita, working in the WINQ group. I completed my Ph.D. at the Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen University, and my master's at the Politecnico di Milano and KTH in Stockholm.
- 👀 My research interests lie in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanoelectronic devices for quantum computing applications and beyond.
- 🌱 On the side, I’m exploring quantum algorithms and machine learning applications for complex systems.
- 🔬 Follow my research on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DcMhFnYAAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao).
